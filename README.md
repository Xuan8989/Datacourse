# Coursera Course - Getting and Cleaning Data 
The final project explore the area of wearable computing, where data was obtained through the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. This project was deisgned to equip us with skills in data obtaining, cleaning, for the preparation of more advanced data analysis.

In the project, it shows information about how the wearables are gaining insights into consumer's demands. Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Under this repo, there are four files, plus original data that was uploaded for references. 

## Files:
 - Data - original data from the course where we need to clean and analyze.
 - CodeBook.md - Contains the information about the variables and how the analysis was performed to transform the original data into tidy data.
 - run_analysis.R - Run through each steps in accordance to the course requirements to product expected final data set.
 - tidydata.txt - Final data set
